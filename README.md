# Obsidian / Quartz / GitHub Pages Template

Deployed URL: https://defenderofbasic.github.io/obsidian-quartz-template

Template for hosting your Obsidian notebook on GitHub pages with CI deployment. 


## Raw HTML pages

There is a [source/raw_html](./source/raw_html) folder that gets copied into the build folder in CI. This lets you host arbitrary HTML outside of quartz. Example: https://defenderofbasic.github.io/obsidian-quartz-template/raw-html-test.html

I made the "raw HTML" option for people who are generating HTML UI's with Claude/ChatGPT but want to tweak them/host them themselves. Or make a personal archive of web pages, etc.

## Further customization

> Quartz is meant to be extremely configurable, even if you donâ€™t know any coding. Most of the configuration you should need can be done by just editing quartz.config.ts or changing the layout in quartz.layout.ts.
